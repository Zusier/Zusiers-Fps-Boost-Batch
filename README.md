# About
Zusier's Optimization Batch File is made to boost your performance and decrease time setting up all my tweaks.

# Is this safe? Why should I use it?

This batch file was made for personal use, but I felt not many stable and effective batch files existed, so I oriented it to the user.
Because the bat is in early use and creation, the bat may be unstable. I have tested the .bat on MANY VMs and it seems to run fine. If you seem to find an issue, report it [here.](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/issues/new)

# How do I use it?
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/releases) and download it
2. Unzip Bat.zip 
3. Run Zusier AIO.bat as admin (though it will prompt you if not anyway)
4. let it run and type Y or N when questions are asked
5. Enjoy :)
