# About
Zusier's Optimization Batch File is made to give a perfect balance in performance, latency.

# Is this safe? Why should I use it?

**Disclaimer:** If you are on a microsoft account, when given the option to disable Microsoft store, click No.

This batch file was made for personal use to decrease time tweaking pc's, but I felt not many stable and effective batch files existed, so I oriented it to the user.
Because the batch is in early use and creation, the bat may be unstable. I have tested the .bat on MANY VMs and it seems to run fine. If you seem to find an issue, report it [here.](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/issues/new)

2. Unzip Bat.zip 
3. Run Zusier AIO.bat as admin (though it will prompt you if you don't anyway)
4. let it run and type Y or N when questions are asked
5. Enjoy :)

# I'm having an issue, how do I report it?
You can report issues [here.](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/issues/new) it will also be easier to help you if you run it in "debug mode". Open the batch in notepad or a text editor and remove "@echo off" then run the batch from cmd BUT running it as "Zusier AIO.bat" >>log.log
