# About
Zusier's Optimization Batch File is made to give a perfect balance in performance, latency.

# Is this safe? Why should I use it?

This batch file was made for personal use to decrease time tweaking pc's, but I felt not many stable and effective batch files existed, so I oriented it to the user.
Because the batch is in early use and creation, the bat may be unstable. I have tested the .bat on MANY VMs and it seems to run fine. If you seem to find an issue, report it [here.](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/issues/new)

# How do I use it?
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch/releases) and download it
2. Unzip Bat.zip 
3. Run Zusier AIO.bat as admin (though it will prompt you if you don't anyway)
4. let it run and type Y or N when questions are asked
5. Enjoy :)

# What Does This Tweak Do?
This tweaks:
-Mouse and Keyboard Responsiveness

-Blocking some Telemetry and Data Tracking

-Optimizes Window's Visual Effects

-Improves System Latency

-Tweaks BCDedit (boot time, latency, HPET etc)

-Ability to customize Services Via [OptiZ Script](https://github.com/HydroTweaks/Optiz_Services)

-Disabling Fullscreen Optimizations 

-Network Optimization (most manually entered from TCP optimizer)

-Debloats Useless Packages

-GPU Tweaks & Disables Power Throttling

-Cleans multiple Temp Folders (no loss to programs using temp)

A Disclaimer before the credits: i know there is some drama (I would call it) about tweaking, bad tweaks, stolen tweaks etc. If you have an issue with a tweak or believe there is discredit here, please pm me on discord or make an issue on Github.
This batch file has been created by Zusier (me) but I have used multiple sources:

[OptizScript](https://github.com/HydroTweaks/Optiz_Services) (created by Hydro) 

[N1kobg](https://n1kobg.blogspot.com/) (some registry tweaks)

[Revision Community](https://discord.gg/962y4pU)

[Melody & Community](https://discord.gg/fzWpQgm) Some latency and network tweaks but most of all provided machine_specific.exe (disables sleep, enables msi, and optimizes devices for latency in a machine specific manner.)

[Calypto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2-lUJq74wuYK1WrA_bIvgb89dUN0sj8-hO3vqmrau4/edit?usp=sharing)  A honorable mention to the ultimate latency guide.
